<b> Story 1:</b>

I used to think in my childhood that to travel in flights. It became possible when I was in undergraduate.I used to think taht prices would be so high. When I travelled I found the prices to be affordable.

<b> Story 2:</b>

I learned machine learning algorithms and I want to make the prediction on any real world data.

<b>Story 1 âˆ© Story 2:</b>

1. I thought of why not predict the prices of flights.
2. Here we have also implemented the prediction and in bottom we also fetched the real time airline name, prices, Departure time of the particular date selected. 
3. This is the project which shows end to end Implemention in the ipynb notebook provided in this folder.
